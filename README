 ImageToolBox: a set of small tools for image processing
================================================================================

This project contains simple command line tools to process image files.
Most code parts were automatically generated by LLMs such as ChatGPT and Gemini.

Most tools support JPEG/TIFF/PNG as input files and output files.  The format
is determined by the file extension (.jpg, .tif, .tiff, .png).

Required libraries are the following.

  OpenCV2, NumPy

Optionally, those tools can be executed implicitly.

  ExifTool

--------

itb_stack : Stack and merge images into one.

  This is useful to make pseudo-STF images and HDR images.
  For pseudo-STF, take multiple images with various apertures.  If you can use
  aperture bracketing, just input the images.  They are stacked and merged into
  a image by average composition.

  $ itb_stack input*.jpg -o output.jpg

  Most cameras support exposure bracketting.  If you use it on the S mode with
  a fixed ISO, images are taken with various apertures but exposure is different.
  Then, set -ax option, which adjusts exposure of each input image before merging.
  
  $ itb_stack input*.jpg -o output.jpg -ax

  You can adjust brightness and contrast of the merged image manually.

  $ itb_stack input*.jpg -o output.jpg --slog 1.5 --sigmoid 0.8
