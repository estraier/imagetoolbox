 ImageToolBox: a set of small tools for image processing
================================================================================

This project contains simple command line tools to process image files.
Most code parts were automatically generated by LLMs such as ChatGPT and Gemini.

Most tools support JPEG/TIFF/PNG as input files and output files.  The format
is determined by the file extension (.jpg, .tif, .tiff, .png).

Required libraries are the following.

  OpenCV2, NumPy

To install them, run the following command.

  $ pip3 pip3 install opencv-python-headless numpy

Optionally, those tools can be executed implicitly.

  ExifTool

----------------

itb_stack : Stack and merge images into one.

This is useful to make pseudo-STF images and HDR images.
For pseudo-STF (smooth transfer focus), take multiple images with various
apertures.  If you can use aperture bracketing or do it manually, just input
the images.  They are stacked and merged into a image by average composition.

  $ itb_stack input*.jpg -o output.jpg

Most cameras support exposure bracketting.  If you use it on the S mode with a
fixed ISO, images are taken with various apertures but exposure is different.
Then, set -ax option, which adjusts exposure of each input image before merging.
  
  $ itb_stack input*.jpg -o output.jpg -ax

To make a HDR (high dynamic range) image from images taken by exposure
bracketting, run the following command.  It merges input images by Debevec
method and apply tone mapping by Reinhard method.

  $ itb_stack input*.jpg -o output.jpg -m d -r

You can adjust brightness and contrast of the merged image manually.

  $ itb_stack input*.jpg -o output.jpg --slog 1.3 --sigmoid 2.4
